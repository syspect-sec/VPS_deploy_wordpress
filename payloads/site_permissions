# Instructions: Each record should be formatted as the sample below.
# <file> specifies in the directory and <dir> will change permissions on directory.
# Lines that start with '#' will be ignored
# SELinux permissions need to be adjusted for Centos.
# Apache needs special read or write permissions.
# These are handled with <se-dir-read> and <se-dir-read-write>
# Examples:
# Sample 1: 0440 on all files recursively in directory path /var/www/
# <file> -R 0440 /var/www/html/
# Sample 2: 0770 on only a single directory
# <dir> 0770 /var/www/html/yoursite/uploads/
# Sample 3: recursive read for SELinux on the entire web-application directory
# <se-dir-read> -R /var/www/html/yoursite/
# Sample 4: read write permissions on a specific directory
# <se-dir-read-write> /var/www/html/yoursite/logs/
#
# All files in the mail WordPress directory get written with 644
#
<file> -R 0644 /var/www/html/github_repo_name/
#
# All directories in web-root get written with Apache execute only
#
<dir> -R 0733 /var/www/html/github_repo_name/
#
# Give SELinux read permissions to web-root
#
<se-dir-read> -R /var/www/html/github_repo_name/
#
# Allow write to log directory
#
<se-dir-read-write> -R /var/www/html/github_repo_name/extra_files/logs/
#
# Allow write all to directories
#
<se-dir-read-write> -R /var/www/html/github_repo_name/
#
# Allow execute to the scripts for initializing app
#
#<file> 0500 /var/www/html/github_repo_name/extra_files/scripts/
